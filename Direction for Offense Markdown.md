**Direction for Offense**



In this assignment I sought out to determine if using the entire field would be a major contributor to offensive production in baseball. The thought is that if a hitter is able to hit the ball consistently to left field, center field and right field it would be increasingly difficult to defend against him. With more and more teams employing defensive shifts to improve their defensive production I wondered why more batters do not take advantage of open space on the field. 

Growing up I was always told to use the whole field when hitting. I would sacrifice some power for "placement" of the ball in the field of play to get hits. I decided to see if that old idea was true.



Below is a chart showing the relationship of offensive output to the direction of the ball being hit. Notice how the "Pull Side" has the best correlation to offensive output. It essentially flat lines after about 45%. This says that using the whole field does not correlate to offensive output.
